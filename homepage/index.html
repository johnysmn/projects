            <p>My name is <button class="btn btn-dark"><b id="name">Johny!</b></button>
            <div>This page is a quick introduction about who I am and how my journey started. But there's more! If
                you're curious to learn a bit more about me, feel free to explore the other sections of my site:
            </div>

            <li>In the <a href="hobbies.html">Hobbies page</a>, I talk about the things I enjoy doing in my free
                time —
                the stuff that keeps me inspired and balanced outside of work and studies.</li>

            <li>In the <a href="goals.html">Goals page</a>, I share some of my personal and professional
                aspirations,
                including where I see myself in the future and what I'm working towards.</li>

                <li>If you ever feel like reaching out, the <a href="contact.html">Contact page</a> has a few ways you can get in touch.</li>

            <li>And finally, there's the <a href="timeline.html">Timeline page</a> — a visual walkthrough of the key moments in my life so far,
                like
                where I’ve lived, important decisions, and milestones in my tech journey.</li>
