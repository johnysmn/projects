                <h2>Short-Term Goals</h2>
                <p>In the short term, I'm focused on growing professionally in the tech field. I'm currently
                    transitioning from my job in telemarketing into the world of programming, and I'm constantly
                    learning and developing my skills.
                </p>
                <p>Another important goal is to gain experience and build a strong portfolio that will help me open
                    doors in the international job market — especially in Canada, where I plan to live in the future.
                </p>
                <p>I'm also working on improving myself personally: learning new things every day, staying disciplined,
                    and strengthening my relationship with my girlfriend, with whom I hope to build a life together.
                </p>

                <h2>Long-Term goals</h2>
                <p>My biggest long-term dream is to become an Artificial Intelligence Engineer — not just working with
                    AI, but truly mastering the field and contributing to real innovations.
                </p>
                <p>I also dream of living in Canada, building a solid and fulfilling life there, both professionally and
                    personally.
                </p>
                <p>And of course, I have some personal dreams too: buying my dream car — an Audi R8 — and one day owning
                    a beautiful mansion. More importantly, I want to build a happy and loving family with my girlfriend,
                    turning all these dreams into reality together.</p>
